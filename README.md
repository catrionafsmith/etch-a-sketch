**Built with:** HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript

**What I have learned:** I learned how generate to dynamically generate items and change the colour of the containers using JavaScript.

**Issues faced and how I resolved them:** I found it difficult to organise the containers into a square initially, but after trying out various solutions from StackOverflow, I found one that suited my use case, using flex display.
